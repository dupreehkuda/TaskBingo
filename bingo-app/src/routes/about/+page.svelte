        <h3>Genesis</h3>
        <p class="text-base font-normal">
          In the throes of Covid lockdowns, when days melded into nights, my productivity levels were so low,
          they would make a sloth look like an overachiever. But then, amidst the haze of takeout containers
          and unwashed laundry, the concept of Task Bingo took its first breath.

        <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
        <p class="text-base font-normal">
          Frankly, our initial version wasn't winning any beauty contests. It was a scrappy mess hastily pieced together.
          The graphics? Primitive. The UX? Donâ€™t even ask. But it worked, and that's what mattered.

        <h3>Hiatus</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal">
          As quarantine faded, our lives began to resume some semblance of normality.
          Energized, productive, and even a tad athletic, we drifted away from our creation.
          The Task Bingo files were cast aside, lost in the chaos of other fleeting aspirations.

        <h3>The Awakening</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal">
          Fast forward a bit. Motivation? Plummeted. Enthusiasm? Non-existent.
          As the days blurred, a ghost of an idea whispered, "Remember Task Bingo?"
          It wasn't so much an epiphany, more like stubbing your toe and finding a lost toy.
          However, this time, the bar was set higher.

        <h3>The Grind</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal">
          Building the new version wasn't a walk in the park. More like trudging through a swamp with
          a backpack full of bricks. Between the coding hiccups and the occasional bout of good ol'
          procrastination, the journey had its fair share of bumps. But hey, nothing that a bit of elbow grease couldn't fix.

        <h3 class='beta'>Endgame</h3>
        <p class="mb-4 text-base font-normal">
          Here we are, a tad later than anticipated - the beta version of taskbingo is now a reality.
          Still rough around the edges, maybe has a bug or twenty, but damn, isn't it a sight to behold?
          Plans for development are brewing, but for the moment, taskbingo is taking a short intermission. Stay tuned.
